# Data Sourcing Challenge

Challenge assignment to use APIs to recommend movies by reviews and related movies

## Running

Make a copy of `.env.example` named `.env` and fill in your own API credentials for The New York Times and The Movie Database.
_Do **not** put your credentials in the example file, to avoid accidentally committing/pushing them as public code changes._

Then, use Jupyter Notebook to run `retrieve_movie_data.ipynb`.
